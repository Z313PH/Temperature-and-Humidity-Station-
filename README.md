# ESP32 Temperature and Humidity Monitoring Station



## Overview

This project utilizes an ESP32 board to create a temperature and humidity monitoring station. The station periodically measures temperature and humidity and displays the readings on a 16x2 LCD screen. It combines two separate Arduino setups into a single one, integrating an LCD screen and a DHT11 sensor.

## Features

- Real-time monitoring of temperature and humidity.
- Easy-to-understand visual display on LCD screen.
- Adjustable contrast for LCD screen.
- Simple setup using readily available components.

## Components Used

- ESP32 board
- DHT11 sensor
- 16x2 LCD screen
- Potentiometer (for contrast adjustment)
- Breadboard
- Power supply
